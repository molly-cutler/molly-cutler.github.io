Hello! I'm Molly and I'm a first-year PhD student in linguistics at NYU. I am primarily a sociolinguist, with additional interests in syntax-semantics and in psycholinguistics and acquisition. You can read more about my research interests below.

Prior to starting at NYU, I received an A.B. in Linguistics from Princeton University, with a certificate (minor) in Cognitive Science. At Princeton, my senior thesis was advised by Alex Göbel and my junior paper (thesis) was advised by Catalina Méndez Vallejo, and I was a research assistant with Casey Lew-Williams and Martin Zettersten in the Princeton Baby Lab.
